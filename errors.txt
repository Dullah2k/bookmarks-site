=============== ERROR 1 ================
Shows Logged out page of the Django administration site instead of my own Logged
out page

== FIX 1 ==
check the INSTALLED_APPS setting of your project and make sure that django.contrib.admin 
comes after the account application.

== FIX 2 ==
Apparently in this case, i named the template logout.html instead of logged_out.html
